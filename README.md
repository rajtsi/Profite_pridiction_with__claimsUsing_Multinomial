The provided code simulates the prediction of profits for a medical insurance company. Here's a breakdown of the code and its functionality:

Importing libraries: The code imports the necessary libraries, including random for generating random numbers and matplotlib.pyplot for plotting graphs. It also imports the multinomial function from the scipy.stats module.

User Input: The code asks the user for the number of times they want to run the simulation (mc variable).

Define Parameters: The code defines various parameters related to the insurance policy, such as the term (duration) of the policy, the number of customers, the sum insured, the premium, and the risk-free interest rate. These values are randomly generated within specific ranges.

Define Claim Amounts: The code defines the amounts to be claimed for each disease category based on the sum insured. The amounts are assigned to variables prize_1 to prize_8, representing the claim amounts for each category.

Generate X and Y Values for Plotting: The code initializes empty lists x and y to store the X and Y values for plotting the graph.

Randomly Generate Number of Claims: The code defines a function randomClaim() that generates a random number of claims for each term in the policy duration. It returns a list of claim counts.

Generate Random Probabilities: The code defines a function generate_random_probabilities() that generates random probabilities for each disease category. These probabilities are used in estimating the number of people in different claim categories.

Estimate Claim Counts: The code defines a function estimate_claim_counts() that estimates the number of claims for each disease category based on the total number of claiming customers and the probabilities of claiming for each category. It uses the multinomial.rvs function to generate random samples from the multinomial distribution.

Calculate Profit: The code defines a function profit() that calculates the net profit for each term in the policy duration. It uses the estimated claim counts, calculates the claimed amount based on the claim amounts and claim counts, and updates the net profit accordingly.

Run Simulation and Plot Graphs: The code runs the simulation mc times and plots the net profit for each term in the policy duration. It also highlights the maximum profitable path in black color. The graph is labeled with the input values and the maximum profit achieved after the specified number of years.

Display the Graph: The code displays the graph using plt.show().
