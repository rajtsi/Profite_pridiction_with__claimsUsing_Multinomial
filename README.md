README: Prediction of Profit for a Medical Insurance Providing Company
This code is aimed at simulating the prediction of profit for a medical insurance providing company. It uses random values for various parameters and estimates the profit based on the number of customers, their claims, and other factors. The simulation is run multiple times, and the results are visualized using a line graph.

Prerequisites
To run this code, make sure you have the following:

Python 3.x installed on your system.
The following Python libraries installed: random, matplotlib.pyplot, scipy.stats.multinomial, and numpy.

Running the Simulation
Upon running the code, you will be prompted to enter the number of times you want to run the simulation (mc). Enter an appropriate value and press Enter.


The code will generate random values for various parameters such as the sum insured, premium, and interest rate.

The simulation will estimate the profit for each year based on the number of customers, their claims, and the specified probabilities.

The results of each simulation run will be plotted on a line graph. The simulation with the highest profit will be highlighted in black.

The graph will display the input values and the final profit.
